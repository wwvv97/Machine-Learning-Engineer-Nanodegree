# Starbucks Capstone Project - Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

This repository contains code and associated files for the final project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. 

## Project Overview
Currently, Data Science is a necessary tool in almost every enterprise in the world. The extent in which data is being analyzed in order to achieve different outputs is huge. As a result, it is important for the leaders in the organizations to know the different problems data could solve, and get the job done. In this project, it is expected to run a model for Starbucks, one of the most famous branches in the world, to make an analysis of which offers could be better to be sent to customers to make them acquire their products, based on simulated data. Personally, I expect to learn more about how to predict the best output for distinct groups of customers.

## Problem Statement
Starbucks needs to develop a model to identify clusters of customers depending on their personal information and on their historic activities. The main goal is to define if a customer has to receive an offer or not, and, if the customer has to, to which type of offer they are more responsive.

Starbucks and Udacity provide the main sources in order to execute the project successfully. The information is simulated based on what Starbucks actually get when working on their Rewards Program. The sources of information are the three following datasets:

1. profile.json - This dataset contains the users of rewards programs for Starbucks. It contains information like the age, gender, income, and date of becoming a member of the program. 

2. portfolio.json - This dataset contains the data of offers sent during a 30-day test period. It contains information of rewards, channels, difficulty, duration, and offer type.

3. transcript.json - This dataset contains the information of the events. In this case, the event is referred to what happened to the offers. The offers could be received, viewed, a transaction could be made, and the offer could be completed.

## Important Documents
There are some important documents to watch:

1. Starbucks-Capstone-Project-Report.pdf - it contains all the relevant information about the project, divided in five important parts: Definition, Analysis, Methodology, Results, and Conclussions & Recommendations.
2. Starbucks-Capstone-Project-DataPrep-FeatEngineering-And-Modeling.ipynb - it contains all the codes used in order to achieve the goal.
3. Additional documents - You can find two additional Jupyter Notebooks (ipynb format) that contain some exploration of the data (Data-Exploration.ipynb) and some visualizations (Visualizations-for-Starbucks-Capstone-Project.ipynb). Also, you can find attached the "lib" folder which contains some useful Python codes for preprocessing and utils that are useful for the project. Also, there is an image that describes the Linear Learner model in the folder mentioned before. As a last point, the "data" folder contains the starting datasets and the datasets that were created while coding for the project.
