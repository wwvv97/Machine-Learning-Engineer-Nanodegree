# Machine-Learning-Engineer-Nanodegree

In this repository, I present the projects I made for my Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Certificate. In every project, I used Amazon Sagemaker (a component of Amazon Web Services), and Jupyter Notebooks (coding with Python) in order to reach my objective of learning more about Machine Learning in a more technical way.
The projects are the following:

1. **Sentiment Analysis Web App** - Here I use an algorithm in order to detect if a movie comment is positive or negative. I also connect an API to a web app through Amazon Web Services to connect the algorithm with the web app.

2. **Plagiarism Detector** - Here I run a Neural Network algorithm to compare two texts and detect plagiarism between them.

3. **Starbucks Capstone Project** - This project consists of defining whether a customer has to receive an offer or not,  and which type of offer are they more responsive to.

For each project I uploaded every useful file, and for the final project I even attach the project report.
